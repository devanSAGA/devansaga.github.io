One thing I specifically liked about his articles is his mostly every articles starts with the question "What problems does this thing solve?" like what is the motivation behind this, which I believe really helps while learning the concept. If you are looking for full explanation on any modern JavaScript (ES6/ES7) feature then Tyler got you covered. He also has written many articles on React Router.'
