    summary:
      "My work primarily involved working with React and Redux and to create responsive layouts and maintain the existing ones. I quickly understood the code base and improved it over time to make the development process faster. I also collaborated with Back End Developers and handled the ownership of developing front ends of two major feather updates and shipped them to production. Apart from that I also worked on migrating PHP code to React. Along with enhancing my React and Redux concepts, this work experience has also helped me improve my modern JavaScript (ES6) and version control understandings. "
